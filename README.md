# ML-Marketing-Campaign-Clustering
## Project Description
In the realm of business expansion, profound insights into customer behavior hold the key to accelerated growth. The journey to success necessitates a keen understanding of customer personas, enabling companies to craft tailored services and offerings that resonate with their audience, ultimately cultivating unwavering customer loyalty. A pivotal step towards achieving this understanding lies in harnessing historical data from marketing campaigns. This reservoir of information holds the potential to unlock the secrets of customer preferences, behaviors, and patterns. By delving into this treasure trove, companies can not only fine-tune their marketing strategies but also identify the customer segments most inclined to engage in transactions on their platform. <br>
In this pursuit, the crux of our endeavor is to construct a robust cluster prediction model that stands as a guiding light for companies navigating their strategic decisions. At the heart of this model are two advanced techniques that fuel its precision: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the K-means++ clustering algorithm. <br>
